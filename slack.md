# Slack @ Uvic Virtual
[Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-) is our central communication hub for everything Uvic Virtual related. It has a ton of helpful features to keep our information straight. This page has a couple guidelines we follow to help keep things clear.

## Threaded Slack
We use threads in Slack to keep channels clean and conversations consolidated. Check out Slack's [threads guidelines](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-and-file-threads) for info.

Please try to start a thread instead of posting a reply to the channel whenever possible.

## One message per idea
Putting lots of text in one message (so before you send it) makes it easier to reply to with a thread.

## Transparency
It's easier to keep everybody in the loop if everybody can read the conversation. Ask questions in channels and [mention](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205240127-Mention-a-member) people that can answer instead of directly messaging so that other people can learn from your answers :smile:
