# Welcome to UVic Virtual!
We're glad to have you on the team! This page lays out the steps you can take to join the club, find a project and start creating in VR!

## Step 1: Join the slack
You should have gotten a sign up link in an email after you filled out your [introduction form](https://uvicvirtual.ca/#join-us). If not, please email [uvic.virtual@gmail.com](mailto:uvic.virtual@gmail.com) and we'll get you set up :smile: The slack is where you can find out about upcoming meetings, meet other people who are into VR and join projects.

## Step 2: Install Unity
We currently use Unity version 2019.2.9f1.  You can install it with [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).  Some old projects use [2017.4.1f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2017.4).
